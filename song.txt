People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

[Chorus]
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

Streets are uneven when you're down
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Faces look ugly when you're alone
People are strange when you're a stranger

Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
