<<<<<<< HEAD
People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

[Chorus]
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

The first string of the song
The second string of the song
The third string of the song
The fourth string of the song

The fifth string line of the song
The sixth string line of the song
